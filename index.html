                                <p class="target-description">HTML, the invisible architect of the web, acts like a blueprint for web pages. It uses simple tags to define structure and content, like headings, paragraphs, and images.  While browsers interpret these tags to create what we see, HTML itself remains hidden, the foundation upon which beautiful and informative websites are built.</p>

                                <p class="target-des" >CSS, the web's fashion designer, breathes life into the HTML blueprint.  It controls the visual style of a webpage, transforming plain text into colorful elements, layouts, and animations.  With CSS, you can change fonts, colors, and backgrounds, making websites visually engaging and user-friendly. </p>

                                <p class="target-des">JavaScript, the web's magician, adds interactivity and dynamism to the HTML structure styled by CSS. Imagine a website that reacts to your clicks, updates live, or plays animations that's the magic of JS. It's the language behind the buttons you press, the games you play online, and the smooth transitions that make web browsing a rich experience.</p>
